I'm an AI research engineer from London. I have extensive experience in Graph Neural Networks, search over LLMs and 3D understanding and reconstruction. Here are a few things I've done:

- I created the horse racing algorithm that is used by almost all bookmakers to calculate the odds of in-play horse racing.
- I started a company at 17 years old selling marketing information to giftware wholesalers.
- I graduated from the Cambridge MPhil program with a distinction. My thesis won the Highly Commended Research Project award.
- I Created a system for [recording video in 3D](https://www.impossiblemotion.io/viewer.html?asset=tennis-demo).

I'm extremely passionate about AI and the future it will bring. If you have any interesting research projects, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sam-considine)! You can find some examples of the work I've done below or in the [posts](/posts) section of this website.
